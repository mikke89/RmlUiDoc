This guide will help you get started when you are ready to integrate RmlUi into your own application. This assumes that you have already [built or installed the library](building_with_cmake.html) from the previous step, or have downloaded the prebuilt package binaries.

If you haven't already done so, take a look at the sample applications in [`/Samples/`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/tree/master/Samples). There you can find a whole heap of useful examples of how to use and abuse RmlUi. Also, be sure to take a look at one or more of the included backends (in [`/Backends/`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/tree/master/Backends)), as they provide a good starting point for getting a basic application up and running together with RmlUi.


### Setting up the build environment

RmlUi is developed following the C++14 standard and can be used on the following platforms:

- Windows 32/64bit, compiling with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017+.
- MacOS 32/64bit, compiling with GCC 5+.
- Linux, compiling with GCC 5+.

#### Conan and vcpkg

If you used Conan or vcpkg to acquire RmlUi, then libraries and include paths should already have been setup for you. The only thing remaining:

- Add `#include <RmlUi/Core.h>` in a source or header file to start using RmlUi.

#### CMake client project
{:#cmake-project}

Add the following to your project's `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(RmlUi REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_application PRIVATE RmlUi::RmlUi)
```

You can pass in the RmlUi build or install path on the command line, or in a CMake preset, by defining the CMake variable `RmlUi_ROOT`. For example, run the following in the directory of your application:

```cmd
cmake -B Build -S . -DRmlUi_ROOT="<path-to-rmlui>"
```

RmlUi generates CMake configure files for both in-source builds and for installs, so this should hopefully just work in either case. When using the prebuilt package binaries, please unpack the files and point the RmlUi path to one of the `Bin-Dynamic` or `Bin-Static` folders, according to the desired linkage type for your project.

It is also possible to target individual components of the library, such as `RmlUi::Core` or `RmlUi::Debugger`. The `RmlUi::RmlUi` target links to all available components.

Then, add `#include <RmlUi/Core.h>` in a source or header file in your application to start using RmlUi.

#### Visual Studio

- Add the RmlUi include path `RmlUi/Include/`{:.path} to your project's include paths.
    - See `Project → Properties → C/C++ → General → Additional Include Directories`{:.path}.
- Add the RmlUi library path (`Debug/`{:.path} and `Release/`{:.path} under the `RmlUi/Build`{:.path} directory as appropriate) and the FreeType library path to your library paths.
    - See `Project → Properties → Linker → General → Additional Library Directories`{:.path}.
- Link with `rmlui.lib`{:.path} and `freetype.lib`{:.path}.
    - See `Project → Properties → Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies`{:.path}.
- If you have RmlUi built as a static library, add the following preprocessor definition: `RMLUI_STATIC_LIB`.
    - See `Project → Properties → C/C++ → Preprocessor → Preprocessor Definitions`{:.path}.
- If you have RmlUi built as a shared/dynamic library, copy the appropriate DLLs into the directory your executable will run from.
    - That is, `Debug/rmlui.dll`{:.path} for debug builds and `Release/rmlui.dll`{:.path} for release builds from the `RmlUi/Build`{:.path} folder, or from the `Bin-Dynamic`{:.path} folder in the release package.
- If you have FreeType built as a shared/dynamic library, copy the `freetype.dll` file into the directory your executable will run from.
- Add `#include <RmlUi/Core.h>` in a source or header file to start using RmlUi.

#### Linux and MacOS

- Add the RmlUi include path `RmlUi/Include/`{:.path} and library path `RmlUi/Build`{:.path} to the paths in your build system.
- Link with `rmlui` and `freetype`.
- Either copy the RmlUi libraries into your application's working directory, or set a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for MacOS) environment variable.
- When the library is built as a static library, add `RMLUI_STATIC_LIB` as a preprocessor definition in your project.
- Add `#include <RmlUi/Core.h>` in a source or header file to start using RmlUi.


### Initialising RmlUi

Before you can initialise RmlUi, you'll need to set the [interfaces](interfaces.html) that the library uses to interact with your application. There is one compulsory interface, the render interface. Additionally, some applications may want to define a custom system interface for additional functionality.

#### The render interface

The render interface is defined in `<RmlUi/Core/RenderInterface.h>`{:.incl}. It provides a way for RmlUi to send its geometry into your application's rendering pipeline. If you want to get RmlUi up and running as quickly as possible, take a look at the included backends described below.

Once you have a render interface for your application, install it into RmlUi by calling `Rml::SetRenderInterface()`. Note that you must keep the render interface alive until after the call to `Rml::Shutdown()` and destroy it afterward. RmlUi won't release your interfaces.

If you'd like to take an in-depth look at setting up your own render interface, please see the [render interface documentation](interfaces/render.html).

#### The system interface

The system interface is defined in `<RmlUi/Core/SystemInterface.h>`{:.incl}. This provides utilities to perform common tasks such as logging messages, translating strings, or setting the mouse cursor.

In order to create a system interface, you'll need to create a class that inherits from `Rml::SystemInterface`. Override any desired functions based on the requirements of your application. Install the system interface by calling `Rml::SetSystemInterface()` with a pointer to the interface. Note that you must keep the system interface alive until after the call to `Rml::Shutdown()` and destroy it afterward. RmlUi won't release your interfaces.

For more uses of the system interface, please see the [documentation](interfaces/system.html).

#### Backend integration
{:#backends}

To simplify the writing of the above interfaces, RmlUi comes packed with several *backends* that provide the render and system interfaces for a variety of renderers and platforms. All available backends are listed in the [repository readme](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi#rmlui-backends) and located in the [`/Backends/`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/tree/master/Backends) directory.

A backend usually consists of three source files in addition to their respective headers:

- a *renderer* integrating the render interface,
- a *platform* integrating the system interface and submitting input events,
- and finally the *backend* itself - tying the former two together.

If you find a backend that matches your setup, it is recommended to use the underlying renderer and platform directly and compile it within your application. They are also made to be extensible, such as to add the ability to load additional texture formats. The backend itself serves as a sample on how to open a window, handle events, and interact with RmlUi for that combination of platform and renderer.

The following table lists platform- or renderer-specific compile definitions:

| Platform or renderer                           | Define                    | Allowed values | Default value | Explanation  |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|------------- |
| SDL&nbsp;platform&nbsp;&amp; SDL&nbsp;renderer | `RMLUI_SDL_VERSION_MAJOR` | `2` or `3`     | *not defined* | Specify the SDL major version to be used. If not defined, a compile error will occur. |
| OpenGL 3                                       | `RMLUI_NUM_MSAA_SAMPLES`  | Integer        | `2`           | Number of MSAA samples to use for framebuffers constructed by RmlUi for anti-aliasing. Set to `0` to disable MSAA. |
| OpenGL 3                                       | `RMLUI_GL3_CUSTOM_LOADER` | Include path   | *not defined* | Specify the include path to the header of a custom OpenGL loader. When not defined, the built-in [glad-based loader](https://github.com/premake-libs/glad) will be used. Users are themselves responsible for initializing and shutting down any custom loader, on the other hand, the built-in loader will automatically be initialized and shutdown during the calls to `RmlGL3::Initialize` and `RmlGL3::Shutdown`, respectively. |

##### Example

If you use SDL together with OpenGL 3, you can add the following source files directly as dependencies in your project:

- [`/Backends/RmlUi_Platform_SDL.cpp`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/blob/master/Backends/RmlUi_Platform_SDL.cpp).
- [`/Backends/RmlUi_Renderer_GL3.cpp`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/blob/master/Backends/RmlUi_Renderer_GL3.cpp).

Then, you can use the `SDL_GL3` backend ([`/Backends/RmlUi_Backend_SDL_GL3.cpp`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/blob/master/Backends/RmlUi_Backend_SDL_GL3.cpp)) as a starting point or sample reference. This backend in particular also demonstrates how to extend the renderer to load additional texture formats.

The following demonstrates how you can include the `SDL_GL3` backend in your application when using a CMake build script. Here, SDL 3 is being used together with a custom OpenGL loader, and with increased MSAA quality. Remember to additionally copy the contents of [`/Backends/RmlUi_Backend_SDL_GL3.cpp`{:.path}](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/blob/master/Backends/RmlUi_Backend_SDL_GL3.cpp) into your project and modify it as needed.

```cmake
set(RMLUI_BACKEND_PATH ${RmlUi_SOURCE_DIR}/Backends)
add_library(rmlui_backend_SDL_GL3 INTERFACE)
target_sources(rmlui_backend_SDL_GL3 INTERFACE
	${RMLUI_BACKEND_PATH}/RmlUi_Platform_SDL.cpp
	${RMLUI_BACKEND_PATH}/RmlUi_Renderer_GL3.cpp
)
target_include_directories(rmlui_backend_SDL_GL3 INTERFACE ${RMLUI_BACKEND_PATH})
target_compile_definitions(rmlui_backend_SDL_GL3 INTERFACE
	RMLUI_SDL_VERSION_MAJOR=3
	RMLUI_NUM_MSAA_SAMPLES=4
	RMLUI_GL3_CUSTOM_LOADER=<glad/gl.h>
)
target_link_libraries(my_application PRIVATE
	RmlUi::RmlUi
	SDL3::SDL3
	SDL3_image::SDL3_image
	rmlui_backend_SDL_GL3
)
```

#### Initialising the library

Call the global function `Rml::Initialise()` once you have installed the system and render interfaces and RmlUi will start up.


### Creating a context

All elements within RmlUi are part of a context. You must have at least one context in order to load, manipulate and render and interface elements. To create a context, use the `Rml::CreateContext()` function, passing in the name of the new context and its initial dimensions like so:

```cpp
Rml::Context* context = Rml::CreateContext("default", Rml::Vector2i(myScreenWidth, myScreenHeight));
```

You can release the context when you're done with it by calling `Rml::RemoveContext(context->GetName())`. All contexts will automatically be destroyed on shutdown.

#### Updating and rendering

Your application will need to update and render each context it maintains, as appropriate. Call the `Context::Update()` function on each context as often as necessary to update the context (usually after the frame's input has been injected), and `Context::Render()` at the appropriate place in your application's render loop.


### Loading fonts

RmlUi does not come integrated with any fonts (with the exception of the debugger plugin), they must be provided by the user. Font faces can be loaded through the `Rml::LoadFontFace()` function.

```cpp
bool success = Rml::LoadFontFace("assets/my_font_face.ttf");
```


### Loading a document

Once you have a valid context, you can load a document into the context with the `LoadDocument()` function. `LoadDocument()` takes a single parameter, a string with the document's file name. If the load is successful you'll get a pointer to a `Rml::ElementDocument` back; call `Show()` on the document to make it visible.

```cpp
Rml::ElementDocument* document = context->LoadDocument("../../assets/demo.rml");
if (document)
	document->Show();
```

Unload the document by calling `Close()`.

```cpp
document->Close();
```

**Note**: event listeners attached to the document or any of its children must not be destroyed until the next call to `Context::Update()` or `Rml::Shutdown()`.


### Injecting input

Once you've got a document loading and rendering, the next step is to get your input into RmlUi. The context object has a range of functions for sending mouse, keyboard, text, and touch input to the system:

```cpp
// Sends a key down event into this context.
bool ProcessKeyDown(Rml::Input::KeyIdentifier key_identifier, int key_modifier_state);
// Sends a key up event into this context.
bool ProcessKeyUp(Rml::Input::KeyIdentifier key_identifier, int key_modifier_state);

// Sends a single unicode character (code point) as text input into this context.
bool ProcessTextInput(Rml::Character character);
// Sends a string of UTF-8 text input into this context.
bool ProcessTextInput(const Rml::String& string);

// Sends a mouse movement event into this context.
bool ProcessMouseMove(int x, int y, int key_modifier_state);
// Sends a mouse-button down event into this context.
bool ProcessMouseButtonDown(int button_index, int key_modifier_state);
// Sends a mouse-button up event into this context.
bool ProcessMouseButtonUp(int button_index, int key_modifier_state);
// Sends a mouse-wheel movement event into this context.
bool ProcessMouseWheel(float wheel_delta, int key_modifier_state);

// Process touch movements for this context.
bool ProcessTouchMove(const TouchList& touches, int key_modifier_state);
// Process touch start (press) for this context.
bool ProcessTouchStart(const TouchList& touches, int key_modifier_state);
// Process touch end (release) for this context.
bool ProcessTouchEnd(const TouchList& touches, int key_modifier_state);
// Process touch cancel for this context.
bool ProcessTouchCancel(const TouchList& touches);
```

Call the appropriate input functions to inject all relevant user input into your RmlUi context each frame, before you call `Update()`. Note that RmlUi does not translate key presses into text; this is up to the application. Make sure to take a look at the included backends, as they provide key conversion to RmlUi and event handling for different platforms. For more information on each function, see the [user input manual](input.html).


### Debugger

The `RmlDebugger`{:.incl} plugin is a visual debugger for RmlUi elements, inspired by similar debuggers for web browsers. We strongly recommend you use this in your application during development!

To use RmlDebugger, include `<RmlUi/Debugger.h>`{:.incl} in your application and link with `RmlDebugger`{:.incl}. For usage details, see the documentation for the [debugger plugin](debugger.html).


### Where next?

Now that you've had a (very!) brief introduction to RmlUi, it is recommended you read the [core overview](core_overview.html) to get an understanding of the composition of RmlUi. From there, either work your way through the documentation, or dive on into the code and consult it as necessary.
