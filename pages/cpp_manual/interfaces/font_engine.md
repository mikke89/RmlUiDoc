The default font engine used in RmlUi provides an implementation based on the FreeType library. For users who want to render text using their own font system, a custom font engine interface can be constructed to replace the default implementation. In this case, the FreeType dependency can be removed entirely, see the [CMake option](../building_with_cmake.html#cmake-options) `NO_FONT_INTERFACE_DEFAULT` for details.

Some of the most important functions for the font engine interface are given in the following.

```cpp
// Called by RmlUi when it wants to load a font face from file.
// @param[in] file_name The file to load the face from.
// @param[in] fallback_face True to use this font face for unknown characters in other font faces.
// @return True if the face was loaded successfully, false otherwise.
virtual bool LoadFontFace(const String& file_name, bool fallback_face);

// Called by RmlUi when a font configuration is resolved for an element. Should return a handle that 
// can later be used to resolve properties of the face, and generate string geometry to be rendered.
// @param[in] family The family of the desired font handle.
// @param[in] style The style of the desired font handle.
// @param[in] weight The weight of the desired font handle.
// @param[in] size The size of desired handle, in points.
// @return A valid handle if a matching (or closely matching) font face was found, NULL otherwise.
virtual FontFaceHandle GetFontFaceHandle(const String& family, Style::FontStyle style, Style::FontWeight weight, int size);

// Called by RmlUi when a list of font effects is resolved for an element with a given font face.
// @param[in] handle The font handle.
// @param[in] font_effects The list of font effects to generate the configuration for.
// @return A handle to the prepared font effects which will be used when generating geometry for a string.
virtual FontEffectsHandle PrepareFontEffects(FontFaceHandle handle, const FontEffectList &font_effects);

// Should return the point size of this font face.
virtual int GetSize(FontFaceHandle handle);

// Called by RmlUi when it wants to retrieve the width of a string when rendered with this handle.
// @param[in] handle The font handle.
// @param[in] string The string to measure.
// @param[in] prior_character The optionally-specified character that immediately precedes the string. This may have an impact on the string width due to kerning.
// @return The width, in pixels, this string will occupy if rendered with this handle.
virtual int GetStringWidth(FontFaceHandle handle, const String& string, Character prior_character = Character::Null);

// Called by RmlUi when it wants to retrieve the geometry required to render a single line of text.
// @param[in] face_handle The font handle.
// @param[in] font_effects_handle The handle to the prepared font effects for which the geometry should be generated.
// @param[in] string The string to render.
// @param[in] position The position of the baseline of the first character to render.
// @param[in] colour The colour to render the text.
// @param[out] geometry An array of geometries to generate the geometry into.
// @return The width, in pixels, of the string geometry.
virtual int GenerateString(FontFaceHandle face_handle, FontEffectsHandle font_effects_handle, const String& string, const Vector2f& position, const Colourb& colour, GeometryList& geometry);
```

The `LoadFontFace()` function is called when the user wants to load a font face. When an element is constructed, or some of its font-related properties are changed, it retrieves a `FontFaceHandle` through `GetFontFaceHandle()`. The font engine should then return a unique handle for the given family, style, weight and size.

If any font effects are applied to a given element, a list of such effects are submitted through `PrepareFontEffects()`. It is up to the font engine interface to decide how to handle them. A handle should be returned for the given list of font effects, this handle will later be used during the call to `GenerateString()`. If font effects are not used, there is no need to implement this function.

`GetSize()` is among several functions that should be implemented to allow RmlUi to query properties of the given font face. 

During layouting, it is necessary to know the width of a given string without actually rendering it. Then, `GetStringWidth()` is called by RmlUi, expecting the interface to return the pixel width of the provided string for the given handle. Note that the string is encoded in UTF-8, there are some helper functions in `RmlUi/Core/StringUtilities.h`{:.incl} to iterate over such strings, if desired.

Finally, `GenerateString()` is called to actually generate the geometry of a given string. The face handle and font effects handle previously generated by the interface are provided. The function should return a list of geometry, as well as its pixel width.

See an example implementation of a custom font engine interface in the `bitmapfont` sample.
